# Artificial-Intelligence

## Overview

These projects are my course projetcs for Artificial-Intelligence course. 
Inside each project you can see the description of the project. 
The code is not listed here since the professor may still use the same projects for the course. 
Potential employers can ask me for the code if interested.


## Project 1: Isolation Game

The rules of Dead-end Isolation are simple. There are two players, one game piece and a 7-by-7 grid of squares. At the beginning of the game, the first player places the piece on any square. From that point on, the players altenate turns moving the piece like a Queen in chess (any number of open squares vertically, horizontally, or diagonally). When the piece is moved, the square that was previously occupied is blocked. That square can not be used for the remainder of the game. The piece can not move through blocked squares. The first player who is unable to move loses.

The task is to create an AI that can play and win a game of Dead-end Isolation. I will implement the agent with the minimax algorithm (minimax()) and the Alpha-beta pruning (alphabeta()).


## Project 2: Search

The task is to implement several informed search algorithms that will calculate a driving route between two points in Romania with a minimal time and space cost. I will implement priority-queue, BFS-search, Uniform-cost search and A-star search at the beginning, then I will implement Bidirectional uniform-cost search, Bidirectional A-star search and Tridirectional UCS search algorithms.


## Project 3: Probabilistic modeling

In this project, I will work with probabilistic models known as Bayesian networks to efficiently calculate the answer to probability questions concerning discrete random variables. First, I will build a Bayesian network and set the probabilities for games of three frisbee teams. Then I will perform the sampling by Gibbs sampling and Metropolis-Hastings sampling.
